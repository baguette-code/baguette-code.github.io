These rules are here to keep the fun in FizzySMP. __These rules apply to anyone who plays on FizzySMP.__

**1. Do not use a client or it's features to your own advantage.** You are allowed to use any client / mod / resource as long as it contains no hacks or features that could pose an unfair advantage during normal gameplay. An example of an unfair advantage is xray and kill-aura. Hacks that are exempt from this rule include fullbright. Breaking this rule will result in a temporary blacklist.

**2. Don't conflict (interfere) with the server / it's software.** Breaking this rule could result in a long blacklist if the rule-breaking is provable.

**3. Please listen to any admins.** Action could be taken if not done so.
