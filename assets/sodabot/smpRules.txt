> :minecraft_creeper: FizzySMP Rules 

These rules are here to keep the fun in FizzySMP. If you have any questions submit a question.  These rules apply to anyone who plays on FizzySMP.

1. Griefing or stealing is not allowed on player bases or builds without permission.  War is allowed but destruction should not be made to the spawn area or it's bases / structures. Stuff within spawn can be griefed if permission has been given by baguette man.  Breaking this rule will result in a temporary blacklist, depending on the severity. 

2. Do not use a client or it's features to your own advantage. You are allowed to use any client / mod / resource as long as it contains no hacks or features that could pose an unfair advantage during normal gameplay. An example of an unfair advantage is xray and kill-aura. Hacks that are exempt from this rule include fullbright. Breaking this rule will result in a temporary blacklist.

3. Don't conflict (interfere) with the server / it's software. Breaking this rule could result in a long blacklist if the rule-breaking is provable.

4. Please listen to any admins. Action could be taken if not done so.
