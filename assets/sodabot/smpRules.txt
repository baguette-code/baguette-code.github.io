These rules are here to keep the fun in FizzySMP. __These rules apply to anyone who plays on FizzySMP.__

**1. Griefing or stealing is not allowed on player bases or builds without permission.**  War is allowed but destruction should not be made to the spawn area or it's bases / structures. Stuff within spawn can be griefed if permission has been given by baguette man.  Breaking this rule will result in a temporary blacklist, depending on the severity. 

**2. Do not use a client or it's features to your own advantage.** You are allowed to use any client / mod / resource as long as it contains no hacks or features that could pose an unfair advantage during normal gameplay. An example of an unfair advantage is xray and kill-aura. Hacks that are exempt from this rule include fullbright. Breaking this rule will result in a temporary blacklist.

**3. Don't conflict (interfere) with the server / it's software.** Breaking this rule could result in a long blacklist if the rule-breaking is provable.

**4. Please listen to any admins.** Action could be taken if not done so.
